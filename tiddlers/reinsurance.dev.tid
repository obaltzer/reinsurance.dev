Welcome to reinsurance.dev!

This site's goal is to dive deep into the principles and implementation of reinsurance analytics software. It provides a general overview of reinsurance, its marketplace and participants, but focuses primarily on reinsurance analytics software.

This site does not provide a review of existing reinsurance analytics products available in the market. Instead it aims to offer insights into some of the underlying technologies, models, and assumptions these products are based off. Many of these products are proprietary, but most are rooted in a common set of principles. Our goals is to provide easy access to information about this common set of principles.

Specifically, this site discusses algorithms and implementation of individual reinsurance analytics components across a multitude of applications, such as:

* [[Catastrophe Modelling]]
* [[Financial Modelling]]
* [[Pricing]]
* [[Portfolio Management]]
* [[Portfolio Optimization]]
* [[Capital Management]]
